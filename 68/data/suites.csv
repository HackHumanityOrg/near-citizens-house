## Purpose
Verifies the complete happy path for storing a verified account with real ED25519 cryptographic signatures.

## Preconditions
- Backend wallet is configured as contract owner
- User has a valid ED25519 keypair

## Expected Behavior
1. Verification is stored without panic
2. Account is marked as verified
3. Verified count increments to 1
4. `verification_stored` event is emitted with correct JSON format
5. Account data is retrievable with correct nullifier

## Purpose
Verifies that the bridge can still query verification status from the verified-accounts
contract when it is paused, because read operations (like is_account_verified) are
allowed even when the contract is paused.

## Scenario
1. User is verified before pause
2. Verified-accounts contract is paused
3. Bridge calls add_member (which queries is_account_verified)
4. Verification check succeeds because reads work when paused
