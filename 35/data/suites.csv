## Purpose
Verifies that the bridge can still query verification status from the verified-accounts
contract when it is paused, because read operations (like is_account_verified) are
allowed even when the contract is paused.

## Test 4.1.4 - bridge_handles_verification_contract_pause

## Scenario
1. User is verified before pause
2. Verified-accounts contract is paused
3. Bridge calls add_member (which queries is_account_verified)
4. Verification check succeeds because reads work when paused

## Purpose
Verifies that the backend wallet can successfully create a Vote proposal through the bridge contract.

## Flow
1. Backend calls `create_proposal` on bridge contract
2. Bridge forwards proposal to SputnikDAO
3. Vote proposal is created in SputnikDAO

## Expected
Transaction succeeds without errors.
