Verifies that the bridge can still query verification status from the verified-accounts

## Purpose
Verifies that the backend wallet can successfully create a Vote proposal through the bridge contract.

## Flow

2. Bridge forwards proposal to SputnikDAO
3. Vote proposal is created in SputnikDAO

## Expected
Transaction succeeds without errors.

Verifies that the backend wallet update operation succeeds and the new wallet is correctly stored.

## Note
The contract does not currently emit a backend_wallet_updated event.
This could be added as a future enhancement.
