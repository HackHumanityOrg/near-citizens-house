## Purpose
Verifies that VersionedVerification enum discriminants remain constant for record migration.

## Why This Matters
- If VersionedVerification::V1 discriminant changes, existing records become unreadable
- Lazy migration relies on correctly deserializing V1 records

## Expected Values
- V1: 0x00

## Purpose
Verifies that StorageKey enum discriminants remain constant across contract versions.
These discriminants are used as storage prefixes for NEAR SDK collections.

## Why This Matters
- If StorageKey::Nullifiers changes from 0x00 to 0x01, all existing nullifiers become orphaned
- This is a **silent data corruption** bug - contract deploys but data is lost
- Borsh uses enum declaration order to assign discriminants (0x00, 0x01, 0x02...)

## Expected Values
- Nullifiers: 0x00
- Accounts: 0x01

## Purpose
Verifies the complete happy path for storing a verified account with real ED25519 cryptographic signatures.

## Preconditions
- Backend wallet is configured as contract owner
- User has a valid ED25519 keypair
- NEP-413 signature is properly formatted and valid

## Expected Behavior
1. Verification is stored without panic
2. Account is marked as verified
3. Verified count increments to 1
4. `verification_stored` event is emitted with correct JSON format
5. Account data is retrievable with correct nullifier
